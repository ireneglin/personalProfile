	    		<p>Bipp was an urchin for many years in the town of Waterdeep who often scavenged by the open markets. In the morning she do odd jobs for food and milk, then around noon she would sneak into the theatre on the east side of the market to watch the players rehearse. One day in spring, the small theatre found itself a new patron who wanted to fund a new stage and all new sets for four different plays. The theatre hired a famous old half-elven designer, named Irene, and her building crew to design and create one-of-a-kind suspension devices, moving stage parts, and auto changing backdrops. The construction took weeks and to Bipp's surprise she didn't miss the players at all. In fact, she loved watching the builders work and the old half-elf point with her long drafting ruler and tsk at mistakes. Part way through construction, the old half-elf noticed the smile-y, wide eyed, muddy little gnome sneaking in to watch everyday at noon and found her glee infectious. Irene decided to offer Bipp a place on her team, more for Bipp's sake than her own gain. In exchange for bringing them the best food from the market for the lowest price she could find or bargain for with the crew's allotted meal money, the old half-elf taught Bipp all about the different mechanical components to the grand new stage.
